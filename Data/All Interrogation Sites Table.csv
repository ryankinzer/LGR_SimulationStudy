All juvenile fish released from Methow Hatchery navigate through the outlet channel to reach the Methow River, and returning adult fish also migrate up the outlet channel and are often collected in a trap structure at the head end of the channel. The detection systems in the channel were installed in series and were initially comprised of three model 2001F-ISO portable PIT tag detection units using 24 X 24 pass-through antennas. The site was operated seasonally (from April to June) in this manner until April 2014 when an additional single antenna was permanently affixed to the trap structure and operated year-round utilizing an IS1001 reader.

All fish migrating up the South Fork that try to migrate upstream of the satellite facility are forced into the ladder via a removable weir.  This weir is a permanent structure with removable panels that is very effective at blocking the upriver movement of fish.  Fish have the freedom to move into and out of the ladder at will and are not trapped until they jump a finger weir that is above all array antennas.  Adult Chinook salmon that swim past the array and enter the ladder are sorted by origin.  Natural origin fish are returned to the South Fork above the weir while hatchery origin fish are typically ponded and latter spawned, recycled through the fishery, or released elsewhere in the basin.",1,0,6/1/2009,,"<a href=http://www.ptagis.org/sites/interrogation-site-metadata?IntSiteCode=STR target=""_blank"">Metadata</a>",Hatchery Returns,8,522.303.215.115,1155,44.66687408,-115.7029529,Chris Sullivan,chris.sullivan@idfg.idaho.gov,208-465-8404 x241,IDFG,17060208,South Fork Salmon,170602,Salmon,STR - SF Salmon Satellite Facility,,,,,1
